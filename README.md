### Redux with React

I'm doing this project to learn more about Redux and Redux toolkit, project objective is to avoid PROP DRILLING in React with Redux: first I created a redux folder and store.js file for Root Reducer (the global state) to store global data. 

and to access these data I used useSelector Hook, and to dispach an action to change the state I used useDispatch Hook.

in progress...
